Template Red Black Tree


The motivation for this project was to:

1. Learn about C++ smart pointers and move semantics.
2. Create a self balancing BST suitable for use in a variety of sweep line algorithms.


Planned additions:

1. Example of usage by implementing the Bentley-Ottmann sweep algorithm for segment intersection.
2. Thorough testing of correctness.
3. Exception handling.
